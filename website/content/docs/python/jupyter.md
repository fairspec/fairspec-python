For data scientists and data engineers, [Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/) provide a powerful and flexible environment for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing data.

## Installation

1. **Install Jupyter:** `pip install jupyterlab` - Installs Jupyter Notebook, a web-based interactive computing environment for data science and data engineering. You can use another UI such as Jupyter CLI or Jupyter Desktop.

1. **Install Fairspec:** `pip install fairspec` - Installs the Fairspec Python framework and all its dependencies.

## Usage

1. **Run Jupyter Notebooks:** `jupyter-lab` - Launches the Jupyter Notebook server in the current working directory, which allows you to create and run Jupyter notebooks.

1. **Select Python Kernel in Notebook:** Choose the Python kernel from your notebook's kernel selection menu. VS Code users may need to install the default Jupyter kernel extensions.
